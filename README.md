Since I haven't used create-react-app nor Webpack, to start the project you simply open index.html in root directory.
To speed up development I've used Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI components and styling.
I have splitted up the app in several several components; main component, navigation bar component and component for displaying data.
Data is stored within browser every time the search is completed successfully.
App is mobile friendly, meaning that all features of app and UI are functional on all modern mobile devices.
